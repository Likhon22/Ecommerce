          Our Story
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Founded in 2015, EasyWear began with a simple mission: to provide
            high-quality, comfortable clothing that's accessible to everyone.
            What started as a small online store has grown into a beloved brand
            known for its commitment to quality, sustainability, and customer
            satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey began when our founder, Emily Chen, noticed a gap in the
            market for affordable clothing that didn't compromise on comfort or
            style. With an initial collection of just 20 items, EasyWear quickly
            gained popularity for its versatile designs and excellent customer
            experience.
